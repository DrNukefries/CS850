## Quizzes

There will be 4 quizzes online with the most current schedule posted on mycourses. You get multiple attempts at each quiz. 

## Exams

The exams will be in person and will be scheduled during the semester. There will be one midterm exam in the middle of the semester and one final exam during the finals period.

The exams will contain questions that are either identical to homework assignments or are very similar. There will be no surprise questions, exept possibly for extra credit.

## Programming Language

The class will involve hand-on data analysis using machine learning methods. The recommended language for programming assignments is [R](https://www.r-project.org/) which is an excellent tool for statistical analysis and machine learning. *No prior knowledge of R is needed or expected*; the book and lectures will include a gentle introduction to the language. You can also use Python, Julia, or MATLAB instead if you are confident that you can install appropriate packages and figure out how to solve assignments. 

### R Resources

- [R For Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)
- [Cheatsheets (Markdown and others)](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)

We recommend using the free [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com) for completing programming assignments. R Notebooks are very convenient for producing reproducible reports and we encourage you to use them.

If you are more adventurous, you may want to give nvim-r a try. It is a package for vim/nvim that has excellent R support.

### Python Resources

Book code is available for Python, for example, [here](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python). If you find other good sources, please let me know. [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is a similar alternative for Python. 

## Pre-requisites ##

Basic programming skills (scripting languages like Python are OK) and some familiarity with statistics and calculus. If in doubt, please email the instructor.
